# arcgis-oauth-connector

### Description
This was intended to be an experiment related to using oAuth with ArcGIS.
Because it involves oAuth, running the code locally isn't really an option
(you'll need ArcGIS to be able to reach your machine via HTTP, and "localhost"
ain't gonna cut it). Initially, this could be tested using Replit, however
they've now ratched down the usefulness of their free offering that it's no
longer viable. Therefore, this repo is basically abandoned, but left here
to help show how oAuth connection to ArcGIS can be built (even if trying it
out isn't going to be as simple as just running `yarn; yarn start`).
