# ~~arcgis-oauth-connector~~ arcgis-oauth-avoider ;)

**_Note_**: This repo has been abandoned! It has moved to
https://github.com/toddrun/arcgis-mapview-playground/tree/main/examples/no_auth

### Description
This was intended to be an experiment related to using oAuth with ArcGIS,
but has turned into an exploration of what you can do with ArcGIS even if
you don't have an account.

### Running
Checkout out the repo and then `yarn; yarn start`. That should take care
of everything you need!
